// score calculations

////*********************************************** in timer mode //***********************************************

let score = 0;
answer == correct ? score += 10; time +=2;
answer == wrong ? score += 0; time -=2;

correct answers in a row (count streak >= 2)? add a multiplier;
let multiplier = 0.2;
score = score + 10 * multiplier;
increase multiplier by 0.05 on each correct answer;
on streak break : streak = 0, multiplier = 0.2;

count max_streak too for results;

if all answers (254) are correct and there is time left : score += time_left_in_seconds * 5;

score = (correctAnswers * basePoints) + (remainingTime * timeMultiplier) - (wrongAnswers * penaltyPoints)


////*********************************************** in streak mode //***********************************************

let score = 0;
answer == correct ? score += 10;
answer == wrong ? game over;

let streak be the multiplier = streak/10;
so score = score + 10 * multiplier;
keep a timer -> starts at 0 for every question -> if time < 2s -> score += 20, if time < 4s -> score += 10, if time < 6s -> score += 5; 

score = streakLength * basePoints * multiplier
